How many samples do we have?

>Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Lets make a boxplot:

>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

- Having a G/G in this location is associated with having a reduced expression of this gene. Whereas as having an A/A produces a higher expression compared to A/G and G/G. The SNP does effect the expression of ORMDL3. 

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
